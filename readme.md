# Basic Inventory REST API
## built with Node.js Express.js EJS 
This Storage inventoring app provides a basic frontend to manage items stored in Storage Units, Basements, Attics, Closets, etc.
Currently the Node server hosts the inventory, but will add functionality for MongoDB in future.
Updates to do:
- add error handling with appropriate messaging
- add validation with JOI
- add MongoDB integration
